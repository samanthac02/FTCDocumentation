10/10/22 Meeting
#####

Drivebase:
*********************
We started building this drivebase, which includes 2 ultraplanetary gearboxes, 2 omni wheels, and 4 traction wheels. Unfortunately, we found we built the frame of the drivebase incorrectly and will have to rebuild it next meeting.

Lift Design:
*********************

**Needs and Constraints:**
* Under 14in tall when collapsed (accounts for mounting on 4in wheels)

* Over 30in tall when expanded

**Research:**

**Possible solutions:**

* Linear slides
* Scissor lift
* Elevator

We created the design matrix shown below and decided to build a linear slide for our lifting mechanism. A score was given to each of the mechanism types for the shown categories (1 being bad and 5 being good) and the scores were totaled.

+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------+
| Mechanism Type  | Weight     | Foldability | Efficiency  | Consistency | Total |
+=================+============+=============+=============+=============+=======+
| Linear Slide    | 4          | 3           | 1           | 3           | 11    |
+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------+
| Scissor Lift    | 4          | 1           | 1           | 1           | 7     |
+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------+
| Elevator        | 2          | 5           | 3           | 2           | 12    |
+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------+

**Prototype:**

We found documentation from REV on how to build a linear slide system (https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-build/linear-motion-kit). We realized we are missing many of the parts that are in the linear motion kit, so we planned on printing the parts on our 3D printers.

======================================

10/11/22 Meeting
#####

For this meeting, we wanted to accomplish the following tasks:
 
* Take apart the drivebase

* Change the gearbox composition from 4:3 to 4:5

* Rebuild the drivebase based on REV's instructions

We were able to fix the orientation of the gearboxes, and assemble the single sprocket shaft, double sprocket shaft, and the drive shaft for the gear box. Once we can cut and connect the 4 pieces of 28 link chain to their respective sprockets, we can move onto putting all the railings together. We were also able to organize and discuss our building materials so that they are easily accessible to everyone. 

======================================

10/17/22 Meeting
#####

For this meeting, we wanted to accomplish the following tasks:

* Finish assemblying the drivebase

* Create a program that allows the user to control the velocity of a motor using one of the joysticks on the gamepad. 

We were able to finish assemblying the drivebase. We also tested four motors to confirm they work. We also created a program that allows the user to control the velocity of a motor using one (and two) of the joysticks on the gamepad, as well as a program that can test motors (dual-motor and single motor test modes).

=============================

11/21/22 Meeting
#####

Chiyo, Samantha, Camille, Sumedh, Owen, and Priyanshu met in person to build the robot. We decided to build an 2-bar arm that would be able to reach the low junction. The arm uses a 5:1 gear ratio and an ultraplanetary gearbox. In the end, the arm was able to reach high enough to score in the middle junction.

=============================

11/22/22 Design Meeting
#####

Chiyo, Samantha, Camille, Sumedh, Emily, Lukas, Owen, and Noe met online to discuss the general design of our robot. We decided we want to build a 4-wheel mecanum drivebase, claw made with compliant wheels and reverse virtual arm for our lifting mechanism. After watching FTC matches at Meet 0 and on YouTube, we found that moving in both the x and y directions is incredibly helpful in this game. So, we decided on a mecanum drivebase like the one shown below, which includes 4 ultraplanetary gearboxes and 4 mecanum wheels.

Additionally, we found that a normal open-close type claw would be easier to prototype effectively before Meet 1. Our mentor, Mr. Duan, suggested that we use compliant wheel for gripping the cone. Below is an image of a claw similar to what we plan to design.

For our lifting mechanism, we considered using linear slides, a reverse virtual arm, and elevator in combination with an arm. The factors we considered into our decision include speed, feasibility with our current materials, consistency based on matches we have seen, and stability of the mechanism. We created the design matrix below to decide which mechanism to build, ultimately being a reverse virtual arm. We gave each mechanism a score (1 being bad and 5 being good) and totaled the scores.

+------------------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-----------+-------+
| Mechanism Type         | Speed      | Feasibility | Consistency | Stability | Total |
+========================+============+=============+=============+===========+=======+
| Linear Slide           | 4          | 3           | 5           | 4         | 16    |
+------------------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-----------+-------+
| Reverse Virtual Arm    | 5          | 5           | 5           | 4         | 19    |
+------------------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-----------+-------+
| Elevator and Arm       | 3          | 5           | 4           | 5         | 17    |
