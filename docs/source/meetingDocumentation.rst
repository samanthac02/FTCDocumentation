11/22/22 Design Meeting
#####

Chiyo, Samantha, Camille, Sumedh, Emily, Lukas, Owen, and Noe met online to discuss the general design of our robot. We decided we want to build a 4-wheel mecanum drivebase, claw made with compliant wheels and reverse virtual arm for our lifting mechanism. After watching FTC matches at Meet 0 and on YouTube, we found that moving in both the x and y directions is incredibly helpful in this game. So, we decided on a mecanum drivebase like the one shown below, which includes 4 ultraplanetary gearboxes and 4 mecanum wheels.

Additionally, we found that a normal open-close type claw would be easier to prototype effectively before Meet 1. Our mentor, Mr. Duan, suggested that we use compliant wheel for gripping the cone. Below is an image of a claw similar to what we plan to design.

For our lifting mechanism, we considered using linear slides, a reverse virtual arm, and elevator in combination with an arm. The factors we considered into our decision include speed, feasibility with our current materials, consistency based on matches we have seen, and stability of the mechanism. We created the design matrix below to decide which mechanism to build, ultimately being a reverse virtual arm.
