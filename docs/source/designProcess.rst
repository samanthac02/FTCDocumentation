Lift Design
#####

Need and Constraints:
*********************

* Under 18in tall when collapsed

* Over 30in tall when expanded

Research:
*********************

Possible solutions:
*********************

* Linear slides
* 4-bar Arm
* Elevator


We created the design matrix shown below and decided to build a linear slide for our lifting mechanism. 

Prototype:
*********************

We found documentation from REV on how to build a linear slide system (https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-build/linear-motion-kit). We realized we are missing many of the parts that are in the linear motion kit, so we decided to print the parts on our 3D printers.
