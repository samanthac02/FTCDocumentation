Design Process

On our team, we try our best to follow the engineering design process, which we believe will help us create a successful robot.

Claw Design V1 - Passive Claw
#####

Need and Constraints
*********************

* Able to hold a cone

* Works with a servo motor

Research and Possible Solution
*********************

We saw another FTC team on YouTube that used a passive claw design. Our design is based on the pictures this team posted as well as the functionality described in their video. 


Prototype
*********************

Test
*********************

Our passive claw design was connected to a motor and tested. We found that there was a flaw in the design as it was not restricted in the x-axis.

Improvements
*********************

To improve this design, we plan on fixing this design flaw and making it easier to print on our printers. We also are considering using a different claw design as many other teams have an easier time scoring with a normal open-close type claw.

Lift Design V1 - Linear Slides
#####

Need and Constraints
*********************

* Under 14in tall when collapsed (accounts for mounting on 4in wheels)

* Over 30in tall when expanded

Research and Possible Solution
*********************

Some possible solutions we considered were:

* Linear slides
* Scissor lift
* Elevator

We created the design matrix shown below and decided to build a linear slide for our lifting mechanism. A score was given to each of the mechanism types for the shown categories (1 being bad and 5 being good) and the scores were totaled.

+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------+
| Mechanism Type  | Weight     | Foldability | Efficiency  | Consistency | Total |
+=================+============+=============+=============+=============+=======+
| Linear Slide    | 4          | 5           | 1           | 3           | 13    |
+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------+
| Scissor Lift    | 4          | 1           | 1           | 1           | 7     |
+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------+
| Elevator        | 2          | 4           | 3           | 2           | 11    |
+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------+

Prototype
*********************

We found documentation from REV on how to build a linear slide system (https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-build/linear-motion-kit). We realized we are missing many of the parts that are in the linear motion kit, so we decided to print the parts on our 3D printers.

Test
*********************

When testing our lifting mechanism, we found that there was friction between the stages and the string broke several times.

Improvements
*********************

To fix the friction, we are planning on sanding down the part in between the stages to allow for easier movement. We also want to get more durable string. We also found that the cycle time was a bit slower than we wanted and our lift in general could not support a lot of weight. Because of the difficulty to obtain the parts we need (we 3D printed all of our parts) and the performance of the linear slides, we plan on reconsidering other lifting mechanisms.

Claw Design V2 - Open-Close Claw
#####

Need and Constraints
*********************

* Able to hold a cone

* Works with a servo motor

Research and Possible Solution
*********************

We looked at various robots from Meet 0 and on YouTube, many of which had similar open-close claw designs.

This claw design comprises of 1 motor mount, 4 "bananas", and 2 "banana" mounts. Originally, our design had standoffs to connect the top and bottom bananas, but we had to custom-design a part after finding out we used all of our standoffs.

Prototype
*********************

Test
*********************

We tested the claw and it was able to open in close. However, the side with the shaft had some trouble in movement. We figured out that the clearance on the hole, in which a bearing was located, was too large. This meant that the bearing was causing this side to be somewhat free-spinning.

Improvements
*********************

Because the hole for the side with the shaft was too large, we redesigned the claw with a hexagon in the banana. The hexagon was measured to be the size of the shaft, so the shaft could directly control the banana's movement.

=============================

Lift Design V2 - Reverse Virtual Arm
#####

Need and Constraints
*********************

* Under 14in tall when collapsed (accounts for mounting on 4in wheels)

* Over 30in tall when expanded

* Quick to completely expand

* Uses minimal number of custom / 3D printed parts

Research and Possible Solution
*********************

In researching other FTC robots on YouTube, we came across a video by REV about lift prototypes. This video introduced us to the reverse virtual arm (also known as the reverse virtual four bar). The cycle time was extremely fast and we would be able to make it entirely out of materials we currently have.
