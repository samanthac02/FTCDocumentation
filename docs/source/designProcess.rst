On our team, we try our best to follow the engineering design process, which we believe will help us create a successful robot.

Lift Design
#####

Need and Constraints:
*********************

* Under 14in tall when collapsed (accounts for mounting on 4in wheels)

* Over 30in tall when expanded

Research:
*********************

Possible solutions:
*********************

* Linear slides
* Scissor lift
* Elevator

We created the design matrix shown below and decided to build a linear slide for our lifting mechanism. A score was given to each of the mechanism types for the shown categories (1 being bad and 5 being good) and the scores were totaled.

+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------+
| Mechanism Type  | Weight     | Foldability | Efficiency  | Consistency | Total |
+=================+============+=============+=============+=============+=======+
| Linear Slide    | 4          | 5           | 1           | 3           | 13    |
+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------+
| Scissor Lift    | 4          | 1           | 1           | 1           | 7     |
+-----------------+------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------+
| Elevator        | 2          | 4           | 3           | 2           | 11    |

Prototype:
*********************

We found documentation from REV on how to build a linear slide system (https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-build/linear-motion-kit). We realized we are missing many of the parts that are in the linear motion kit, so we decided to print the parts on our 3D printers.
